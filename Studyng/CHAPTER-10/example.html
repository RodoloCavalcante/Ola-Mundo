        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
        <p>A <em>potager</em> is a French tem for an omamental vegetable or kitchen garden.
        Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhace the garden's beauty. </p>
        <h2>What to plant</h2>
        <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and dorm. Many
            are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers
            and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - from 
            the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formaly of a knot garden.
